# JS_Assessment

Welcome to the course assessment for the JS module!

In this session, you will complete the Find Your Hat project.

By the end of this session, you will be able to: 
Build the Find Your Hat game from scratch.
Explain the steps behind building a JavaScript Application.


*Note: 
The character * can be always at the default of position (0,0) when the user starts the game
The controls for the character are:
Up = u key
Down = d key
Left = l key
Right = r key
If a user entered an invalid key (e.g. p or t), output “Enter U, D, L or R.) and allow the user to enter again
The number of holes generated should be lesser than the fields generated
When the character drops into a hole, output “Sorry, you fell down a hole!” and the game ends
When the character hits the boundaries, output “Out of bounds - Game End!” and the game ends
When the character gets the hat, output “Congrats, you found your hat!” and and the game ends
